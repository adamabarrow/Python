#1) Make a int variable called x set to 0. Make a while loop that prints 
#out x and increments it by one. Make the loop run while x is less than
#or equal to 20.

x = 0 
while(x <= 20):
    print(x)
    x = x + 1


#2) Make a int variable called x set to 0. Make a while loop that prints 
#out x and increments it by one. Add an if statement that breaks the loop
#if x equals 15. Make the loop run while x is less than 100.

x = 0
while(x < 100):
    print(x)
    x = x + 1 
    if(x == 15):
        break
    
#3) Make a int list with three items inside. Make a for loop that prints 
#out all the items.

var = [5, 10, 15]
for x in var:
    print(x)

#4) Make a string list with three items inside: "Michael", "Chris", "Nino". 
#Make a for loop that prints out all the items. Add an if statement that 
#breaks the loop if the item equals "Chris".

var = ["Michael", "Chris", "Nino"]
for y in var:
    print(y)
    if(y == "Chris"):
        break

#5) Make a while loop with a common SYNTAX error.

a = 0 
while(a <= 30)
    print(a)
    a = a + 1

#6) Make a for loop with a common SYNTAX error.

var = [11, 30, 15
for x in var:
    print(x)
