#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.

first = 4 == 4
second = 5 == 5
a = first and second
print(a)

#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.

third = 6 > 3
fourth = 4 < 2
b = third or fourth
print(b)

#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.

fifth = 2 == 2
c = not fifth
print(c)

#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

sixth = 7 > 2
seventh = 9 < 1
b = sixth or 
print(b)
