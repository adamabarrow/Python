This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

a = "hi"
b = "hello"
c = (a == b)
print(c)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

d = 1
e = 1.0
f = (d == e)
print(f)


#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

g = 9
h = 3
i = (g > h)
print(i)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

j = 7
k = 7
l = (j < k)
print(l)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

m = 8
n = 12
o = (m >= n)
print(o)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

p = 5
q = 5
r = (p <= q)
print(r)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

s = 3
t = 2
u = (s = t)
print(u)
