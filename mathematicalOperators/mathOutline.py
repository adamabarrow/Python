#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = "thank" + " you"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 6 + 2
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

z = 7 - 9
print(z)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

d = 3.2 - 1.2
print(d)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a = 9 * 2
print(a)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

b = "pizza " * 3
print(b)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

c = 5 / 2
print(c)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

e = 7.0 / 3.5
print(e)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

f = 8 % 7
print(f)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g = 7 // 3
print(g)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

h = 9 ** 2
print(h)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

h = 3 * 8
print(p)
